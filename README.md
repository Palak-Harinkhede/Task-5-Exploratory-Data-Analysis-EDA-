# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Task 5

**Internship Task – Data Analyst Role**

---

## 🔍 Objective

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (or another relevant dataset) to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.  
The goal is to extract insights using statistical summaries and visualization techniques.

## 📈 EDA Highlights

- **Data Inspection**: Overview using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distributions of individual features (e.g., Age, Fare)
- **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Relationships between features (e.g., Survival vs Sex, Pclass)
- **Visualizations**:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatterplots
  - Heatmaps
  - Pairplots
- **Observations**: Key patterns noted alongside each analysis step

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📌 **Survival Trends**: Higher survival rates among women and children  
- 📌 **Class Impact**: First-class passengers had better survival chances  
- 📌 **Age Distribution**: Right-skewed; most passengers were young adults  
- 📌 **Multicollinearity**: Detected between certain numerical features using heatmap
